Description: 
  Fast partial least squares (PLS) for dense and out-of-core data.
  Provides SIMPLS and NIPALS solvers, plus kernel-style PLS variants
  ('kernelpls' and 'widekernelpls') with parity to 'pls'. Optimized for
  bigmemory-backed matrices with streamed cross-products and chunked BLAS
  (XtX/XtY and XXt/YX), optional file-backed score sinks, and deterministic
  testing helpers. Includes an auto-selection strategy that chooses between
  XtX SIMPLS, XXt (wide) SIMPLS, and NIPALS based on (n, p) and a configurable
  memory budget. About the package, Bertrand and Maumy (2023) <https://hal.science/hal-05352069>, 
  and  <https://hal.science/hal-05352061> highlighted fitting and cross-validating 
  PLS regression models to big data. For more details about some of the techniques 
  featured in the package, Dayal and MacGregor (1997)

  Includes kernel logistic PLS with C++-accelerated alternating IRLS updates,
  streamed RKHS solvers with reusable centering statistics, and bootstrap
  diagnostics with graphical summaries for coefficients, scores, and
  cross-validation workflows, alongside dedicated plotting utilities for
  individuals, variables, ellipses, and biplots.
  The streaming backend uses far less memory and keeps memory bounded across data sizes.
	For PLS1, streaming is often fast enough while preserving a small memory footprint; 
	for PLS2 it remains competitive with a bounded footprint.
	On small problems that fit comfortably in RAM, dense in-memory solvers are slightly faster; 
	the crossover occurs as n or p grow and the Gram/cross-product cost dominates.
